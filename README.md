## Hands-On Workshop: Low-Code AI: Making AI Accessible to Everyone

Learn how you can apply AI in your field without extensive knowledge in programming. This hands-on session includes a quick recap on the fundamentals of AI and three exercises where you will learn how to classify human activities using MATLAB&reg; interactive tools and apps:
1. Accessing and preprocessing data acquired from a mobile device
2. Applying clustering to the unlabelled data using the Cluster Data Live Editor Task
3. Classifying the labeled data using two apps: Classification Learner app and the Deep Network Designer app

At the end of the workshop, you will be able to design and train different machine learning and deep learning models without extensive programming knowledge. You will also learn how to automatically generate code from the interactive workflow. This will not only help you to reuse the models without manually going through all the steps but also to learn programming or advance your coding skills.

To participate in this workshop, you will need a MathWorks&reg; account [(create MathWorks account)](https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register).
